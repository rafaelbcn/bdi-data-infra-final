= Environment variables

An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes behave on a computer. In simple terms, it's a variable whose value is set outside the program, usually in the operating system's environment. These variables are part of the environment in which a process runs and can be accessed by any program running under that environment.

Environment variables are used for various purposes, including:

* *Configuration*: They can be used to configure how software behaves. For example, setting the PATH variable in Unix-like systems specifies directories in which executable programs are located.

* *Customization*: Users can set environment variables to customize their computing environment according to their preferences. This could include setting variables for default text editors, language preferences, or file system paths.

* *Inter-process Communication*: Environment variables can be used by one process to communicate information to another process. For instance, a parent process might pass configuration information to a child process through environment variables.

* *Security*: They can also play a role in security by controlling access to certain resources or features based on the value of specific variables.

* *Debugging and Development*: Developers often use environment variables to configure development and debugging environments. They can control logging levels, debugging options, or enable/disable certain features during development.

Overall, environment variables provide a flexible and standardized way to configure and control the behavior of software and the operating system environment as a whole. They are an essential aspect of system configuration and software development.

== Setting Up Environment Variables in Command Line

=== Windows

1. Open Command Prompt:
   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter.

2. View Current Environment Variables:

3. Set New Environment Variable:
- To set a new environment variable, type: `setx VARIABLE_NAME "variable_value"`
Replace `VARIABLE_NAME` with the name of your variable and `"variable_value"` with its value.

4. Verify the Setting:
   - Close and reopen Command Prompt to ensure the changes take effect.
   - To verify, type `echo %VARIABLE_NAME%`. It should display the value you set.
