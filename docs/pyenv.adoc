= Managing Python Versions with Pyenv

Pyenv is a popular tool for managing multiple Python installations on a single machine. It allows you to easily install, manage, and switch between different versions of Python. Pyenv is particularly useful for developers who work on multiple projects that require different Python versions or need to test compatibility across different Python versions.

== Why Pyenv?

Pyenv offers several benefits that make it a valuable tool for Python developers:

1. **Multiple Python Versions:**
   Pyenv allows you to install multiple versions of Python on your system simultaneously. This is useful for working on projects that require different Python versions or for testing compatibility across different Python versions.

2. **Isolated Environments:**
   Pyenv creates isolated environments for each Python version, ensuring that dependencies and configurations are kept separate. This helps avoid conflicts between different Python installations and makes it easier to manage dependencies for each project.

3. **Version Switching:**
   Pyenv makes it easy to switch between different Python versions on the fly. You can set a global Python version or specify a version on a per-project basis, allowing you to use the appropriate Python version for each project.

4. **Plugin System:**
   Pyenv has a plugin system that extends its functionality. Plugins can add features such as automatic virtual environment activation, integration with package managers, and additional commands for managing Python environments.

== Installing Pyenv

1. **Prerequisites:**
   Before installing Pyenv, make sure you have the necessary build dependencies installed on your system. On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, you can install these dependencies with:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
    libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev \
    libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git
----
+
NOTE: The specific dependencies may vary depending on your operating system.

2. **Install Pyenv:**
You can install Pyenv using the pyenv-installer script, which automates the installation process:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
----
Alternatively, checkout https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation[detailed install instructions]
3. **Verify Installation:**
After installation, verify that Pyenv is correctly installed by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
pyenv --version
----
+
This should display the version of Pyenv installed on your system.

== Using Pyenv

1. **Installing Python Versions:**
 You can install Python versions using the `pyenv install` command followed by the desired version number. For example, to install Python 3.9.7, you would run:
+
[source,bash]
----
pyenv install 3.9.7
----

2. **Listing Available Python Versions:**
You can list all available Python versions that can be installed using:
+
[source,bash]
----
pyenv install --list
----

3. **Setting Global Python Version:**
You can set a global Python version that will be used by default in all shells by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
pyenv global 3.9.7
----

4. **Setting Local Python Version:**
You can set a Python version on a per-project basis by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
pyenv local 3.9.7
----
+
This will create a `.python-version` file in the current directory specifying the Python version to use.

5. **Activating Virtual Environments:**
Pyenv integrates with virtual environment managers like `virtualenv` and `venv`. You can automatically activate virtual environments when entering directories containing a `.python-version` file by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
pyenv virtualenv-init
----
+
This will add the necessary commands to your shell configuration file to activate virtual environments.

== Conclusion

Pyenv is a powerful tool for managing multiple Python versions on a single machine. It simplifies the process of installing, managing, and switching between different Python versions, making it an essential tool for Python developers who work on projects with diverse Python version requirements.
