= Pydantic library

https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/[Pydantic] is a data validation and settings management library for Python.
It's designed to make it easy to define and validate data schemas,
including configuration settings, by using Python type annotations.

TIP: Read always the https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/[official documentation]

== Creating Configuration Settings with Pydantic
NOTE: This is just an example

1. **Defining a Configuration Model:**

To define configuration settings using Pydantic, you create a data model class that inherits from the `BaseModel` class provided by Pydantic. You define attributes for each configuration setting using Python type annotations.

For example:

[source,python]
----
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AppConfig(BaseModel):
    database_url: str
    max_connections: int = 10
    debug: bool = False
----

In this example, `AppConfig` is a Pydantic model representing configuration settings. It has three attributes: `database_url` (a string), `max_connections` (an integer with a default value of 10), and `debug` (a boolean with a default value of `False`).

2. **Creating an Instance of the Configuration Model:**

Once you've defined the configuration model, you can create an instance of it by passing in the configuration values as keyword arguments:

[source,python]
----
config = AppConfig(database_url="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/mydatabase", max_connections=20, debug=True)
----

3. **Accessing Configuration Values:**

You can access individual configuration values as attributes of the configuration instance:

[source,python]
----
print(config.database_url)
print(config.max_connections)
print(config.debug)
----

== Validating Configuration Settings

Pydantic automatically validates the configuration values based on the data types defined in the model. If you try to assign a value of the wrong type, Pydantic will raise a `ValidationError`.

[source,python]
----
# This will raise a ValidationError
config = AppConfig(database_url=123)
----

== Conclusion

Pydantic provides a convenient and Pythonic way to define and manage configuration settings in your Python applications. By using Python type annotations, Pydantic makes it easy to create configuration models with built-in validation, ensuring that your application's configuration is always correct and consistent.

Pydantic is not only used in configuration but also is used in other libraries
like `FastAPI` with the purposes of validating the reciving data and specifying
the schema (contract).
