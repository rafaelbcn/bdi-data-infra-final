. Check out the new code version
. Adapt the endpoints inside the `bdi_api/s7` folder to read from s3 and insert into a postgreSQL RDS
. Adapt read endpoints to obtain data from postgreSQL
  . Use the environment variables `DB_XYZ`
. (Optional) Write your own tests inside `tests/s7`

[IMPORTANT]
--
I'll use those environment variables to connect to my own database to run the tests.

So use them in your code via the class `bdi_api.settings.DBCredentials`.
You'll find them already imported in the variable `db_credentials`

IMPORTANT: Ensure you create/validate everything you need is set in the database.
This includes any table you might need to create.

== Obtaining my changes

[source,bash]
----
git remote add marti https://github.com/martsec/big-data-infrastructure-exercises.git
git fetch marti main
# Let's backup first!
git checkout -b backup_branch_s7
git checkout main
git merge marti/main
# Now solve the conflicts (if any) and commit
# Conflicts will look like <<<<<<  and >>>>>> and will contain both your code and my code
# Often IDEs like pycharm and vscode will have nice user interface to solve them
----

[NOTE]
--
For compatibility reasons I needed to update the open-telemetry library versions
and fix them (`= "1.21.0"`). If you find a conflict with those, let me know.

_(OPTIONAL) Longer explanation_: previously I had `= "^1.21.0"`. This `^` meant that it tried to install upgrades that were compatible (e.g. `1.22.0`) but that was causing conflicts.

== How to deliver the solution

1. Commit and push your code to github.
2. Go to your GitHub's commit history, take a screenshot and upload it to campus

I'll use the latest commit shown in the snapshot to evaluate your code.


== Evaluation

* 5 points: set of evaluation tests
* 2 points: your test coverage and code format
* 1 point: Diagram of the deployed app in AWS (assume RDS and EC2)
* 1 point: RDS database is not open to the internet (ADD SCREENSHOT of RDS configuration)
* 1 point: Response time for `/aircraft/{icao}/stats` is ~< 20ms

== Links of interest

TIP: Try not to use Windows and use WSL2 instead: a linux "layer" for windows.

* https://www.sqlalchemy.org/[SQLAlchemy library]

TIP: If using psycopg, use the binary. This will add it to your pyproject `poetry add 'psycopg[binary]'`
